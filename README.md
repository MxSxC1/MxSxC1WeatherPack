The Dark Is A Cold Lonely Shadow

Custom Rain (Arena Version)
Custom Snow (Sleet)
Remove Rain Splashes
Remove Some Other Particle Effects
Most Other Particle Effects Have Been Moved to mxsxc1_patricles, others are in mxsxc1_ghostpak

Notes/Issues:
Can be intensive and cause slow down. This is much much improved from the High Res Version, and is a lowerquality version for use with the Arena & PVP.
The rain can look a little thick, this is improved on again in High Res Version.
This has been tested in Vanilla and with multiple shaders used by The Dark Is A Cold Lonely Shadow, and in the insanity of The Arena.
This version of the Weather Pack deliberately uses blurred images with additional, barely seen Alpha "residue".
This is entirely deliberate as it looks awesome in some packs, and produces the "sleet" effect. But in some cases it wont be wanted.
Another version of pack with Crisp Snow is working, but a bit too subtle and sparse on the snow side, this will be released later

Alternate Weather Packs:
Pink Sleet & Snow (only really works in Vanilla). Red & Black versions also being worked on.
Crisp Snow. Minimal Alpha removed the Sleet effect.
Giant Snow. Huge Snow Flakes.
High Resolution Snow. Can be insanely intensive at times, but much better quality. Only really used for short scenes or image captures.
Downpour - Very Heavy Rain
Dancing Through Rainbows - This Is Crazy & Can Makes You Feel Sick - Not quite sure have a use for it so low priority.
